/** Class for doing a one-dimensional minimization using
  * the Golden Section algorithm.
  *
  * <P>To do the optimization, a unimodal interval of the
  * parameter being varied must be specified.
  * The interval is given by the lower and upper bound
  * of the parameter specified in the command file.
